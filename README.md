# A Boss Stats

A Boss Stats is a custom indicator developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This indicator is designed to help traders analyze market conditions and identify potential buy and sell signals. The indicator displays colored arrows on the chart to indicate the recommended trading actions.

## Input Parameters

- **ChartTimeframe**: This parameter allows you to select the chart timeframe on which the indicator will be applied. The default value is 1 minute (PERIOD_M1).
- **ExpirationTime**: This parameter sets the expiration time for trades opened based on the indicator signals, measured in minutes. The default value is 1 minute.

## Indicator Buffers

- **BuyBuffer[]**: This buffer stores the values for buy signals. When a buy condition is met, a value of 1 is assigned to the corresponding index in this buffer.
- **SellBuffer[]**: This buffer stores the values for sell signals. When a sell condition is met, a value of 1 is assigned to the corresponding index in this buffer.
- **ArrowBuffer[]**: This buffer stores the values for arrow signals. When an arrow condition is met, a value of 1 is assigned to the corresponding index in this buffer.

## Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers and assigns default values. In this case, the buy buffer is labeled as 'BUY' and the sell buffer is labeled as 'SELL'. The function returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` if initialization is successful.

## Indicator Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is the main calculation loop of the indicator. It iterates over each bar on the chart and checks for buy, sell, and arrow conditions. If a condition is met, the corresponding buffer is updated with a value of 1.

## Buy Condition

The `CheckBuyCondition()` function is called in the calculation loop to check for the buy condition at the current index. Traders can implement their own buy condition logic inside this function. The function should return `true` if the buy condition is met.

## Sell Condition

The `CheckSellCondition()` function is called in the calculation loop to check for the sell condition at the current index. Traders can implement their own sell condition logic inside this function. The function should return `true` if the sell condition is met.

## Arrow Condition

The `CheckArrowCondition()` function is called in the calculation loop to check for the arrow condition at the current index. Traders can implement their own arrow condition logic inside this function. The function should return `true` if the arrow condition is met.
